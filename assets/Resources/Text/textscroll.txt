In the year 3066, <color=#11dd11>nuclear war</color> has reduced Earth to medieval levels of technology.  In this world, there is nothing more valuable than <color=#eeee66>cheese</color>.

Everybody knows the moon is made of <color=#eeee66>cheese</color>, but it was not <color=#eeee66>cheese</color> enough for the <color=#eeee66>cheese-loving</color> <color=#33ddee>Moon Men</color>!  Using the last of their dwindling resources, the <color=#33ddee>Moon Men</color> send their <color=#ff1111>Vast Alien Armada</color> of weird...
Alien...
Antenna'd...
Uh...

No, seriously, what are those things?  Like, are they dust mites?  They look kinda like dust mites.

Anyway,
<color=#ff1111>Vast Alien Armada</color> to conquer the Earth and exploit its <i><color=#eeee66>cheeeese</color></i>!

Do you has what it takes to defend your castle and your <color=#eeee66>cheese</color> from the alien encroachers?
Well?  Do ya?
